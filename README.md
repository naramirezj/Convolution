# Convolution
 The program will return the uploaded image (cookies.jpg) with five different  visual modifications or kernels and save the resulting images.  The filters applied will be: bluring, spot_detection, emboss, sharpen and  edge_detect.  This image modifications are a result of appplying a kernel through all  the pixels in the image and assigning a calculated brightness intensity to them.
